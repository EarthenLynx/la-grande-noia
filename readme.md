# 🐙 La grande noia

> **Invite your friends to events**

The first result I got when using the API behind this app was 'Give your pet 10 minutes of attention'. Now since I lack a real pet, I expanded those 10 mins and gave the attention to the internet. I was curious on trying out Spectre.css and ended up with an application I could use as my crystal ball when looking for activities to kill some time. I've also included a backend Email sending service that might come in handy some time.

The features of the app are quite straightforward

- Clicking the search button returns a random activity from the [Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/)
- It visualizes how many people can join in, how much money and effort it costs
- Clicking the share button allows you to send a mail to other people ( this is disabled in the demo )
